## Succession Plan

1. Policy Statement

York Univeristy Libraries commits to the continued preservation of the information entrusted to its care, even in the event the repository ceases to operate or its governing or funding agency changes in scope.

Since it is impossible to predict exactly what conditions will lead to a situation where the succession plan is necessary, York University Libraries does not outline a specific scenario. Instead, we have established a set of principles which will be used to determine an appropriate course of action that both ensures the integrity of the platform's contents and the rights of the [Designated Community](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/documentation/digital-preservation-designated-community-definition).
