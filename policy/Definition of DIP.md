## Definition of DIP

#### Dissemination Information Package (DIP)

* [OAIS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Archival_Information_System) describes a DIP as "the Information Package, derived from a part, or all, of one or more AIPs, received by the Consumer in response to a request to the OAIS."
* York University Library's DIPs are always generated from a single AIP.
* User access to archival objects is generally provided through the [YUDL website](http://digital.library.yorku.ca](http://digital.library.yorku.ca).
* The user is first authenticated, and will, depending on their level of access, see basic object metadata, and a link to the object article as available.
* Context information is provided in the form of links to other items in a given collection.
* The DIP is retrieved using the URI for the corresponding AIP. In turn, the AIP contains metadata tying it back to the SIP.
