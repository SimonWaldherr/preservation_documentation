#### Personally identifiable information in items in the repository

See Redaction Policy below.

### Redaction Policy
When York University Digital Library is notified of personally-identifying information within a digital object, steps will be taken depending on the type of information in question.

Objects containing certain types of personally-identifying information will be immediately suppressed from public view, and the information will be edited out of the section of the document where it occurs, e.g.: social insurance numbers and driver’s licence numbers.

For requests to redact information that is not the above type of information, York University Digital Library will direct the person requesting redaction to the owners of the original content, as specified in a Memoranda of Understanding , or other contract. In such cases, York University Digital Library has been granted permission within one of these agreements to digitize, host, and make openly accessible this information, and it is by permission of the rights owner that the request will be honoured.

In the event that the rights owners grants permission to redact this information the York University Digital Library will suppress the item from public view while a new derivative of the item is processed which has the information redacted. Upon ingest of the new derivative into the system, the revised item will be made available again. York University Libraries redacts the minimal amount of data to maintain the integrity of the original object.

As a result, there is some content that York University Libraries does not redact, such as:

  * Public announcements (e.g., marriage, death, or birth records)
  * Materials added under valid, signed Memoranda of Understanding
  * Information generated in a public forum
  * Information in the public record
  * Information in the public domain

### Intellectual Property or Copyright Challenge Policy

If an item is identified as being online without sufficient rights provided to York University Libraries by the rights holder, York University Libraries will work with the rights holder to remedy the situation. The expected steps involved in the process include:

  * York University Libraries are alerted to a copyright or intellectual property challenge
  * York University Libraries suppresses the record and access to the digital object during the review period
  * A review of the resource, the partnership or rights agreements associated with the item or collection, and the issues brought up by the rights holder is conducted by York University Libraries
  * York University Libraries communicates with the rights holder the findings of the internal review, and if in error, works with the rights holder to restore access to the resource. If an agreement is not made, then the resource remains suppressed from public access.

#### User Feedback

  * Forms submitted from York University Digital Libraries
  * Direct contact via e-mail or phone calls with York University Libraries

#### Responses
