#### Selection Criteria

York University Digital Library makes available collections that support research and scholarship according to the needs of the [York University Digital Library Designated Community](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/documentation/digital-preservation-designated-community-definition). For inclusion within York University Digital Library, objects must meet all Level One criteria and at least one of Level Two criteria.

**Level One** criteria cover objective standards such as copyright, extent, and format issue. Items must meet all of the criteria in **Level One** to be eligible for addition into York University Digital Library:

Each item must:

* Be in the public domain, or have documented, non-revocable permission granted by the copyright holder, or be allowed by CANADIAN COPYRIGHT -- TO ADD
* Be intended for public viewing and use
* Be complete, such as an entire publication, article, etc., and not a “part” such as an abstract, forward, or title page
* Meet the standards required for long-term digital curation, publicly available from http://www.library.unt.edu/digital-projects-unit/standards
* Be in a standard format accessible through current file viewers or have a documented conversion path to move the format into a standard format
* Be intended for permanent storage in York University Digital Library

**Level Two** criteria cover subjective elements requiring review, assessment, and the professional judgement of the [Digital Initiatives Advisory Group](http://www.library.yorku.ca/web/collections/digitalscholarship/diag-requests/) in collaboration with subject experts. Items must satisfy at least one criterion from these categories:

* Utility - the items support the [York University Digital Library Designated Community](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/documentation/digital-preservation-designated-community-definition) goals: 
  * Research
  * Scholarship
  * Teaching
* Demand - items meet anticipated or demonstrated community demands:
  * Departmental priorities
  * Citation frequency
  * Digital item usage
* Commitment - items meet an obligation or requirement established by external means:

  * Legal requirements
  * Contracts or MOUs

#### Retention and Evaluation

All objects included in York University Digital Library are intended to be retained permanently upon acceptance into York University Digital Library. York University Digital Library will not be used as a temporary storage facility for digital items.

#### Collection Curators ???

York University Libraries provide curators for their digital collections who exercise intellectual and administrative stewardship responsibilities for digital objects stored in the UNT Libraries’ Digital collections. The Digital Collection curator is a role rather than a specific individual, and it is understood that, over time, many different individuals will play this role for a specific collection.

Each Digital Collection Curator will ensure sound stewardship of the collection and will appropriately manage these digital objects over the long-term through standard digital management practices, which include the following:
