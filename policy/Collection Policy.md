# Collection Policy

## Policy Statement

This document describes the policies governing the acquisition, curation, and management of materials in York University Libraries' Digital Preservation Program. These include digital objects created by YUL, university records based on the [Common Records Schedule](https://crs.apps06.yorku.ca/), private archives acquired for research and teaching, and published digital objects that require local hosting and rights management. York University Libraries makes available collections that support research and scholarship according to the needs of the York University Libraries Digital Preservation Program's [Designated Community](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/documentation/digital-preservation-designated-community-definition) and in accordance with its [Digital Preservation Strategic Plan](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/documentation/digital-preservation-strategic-plan). 
  
## Selection Criteria

For inclusion within York University Digital Library, objects must meet all **Level One** criteria and a consideration of **Level Two** criteria.

### Level One

criteria cover objective standards such as copyright, extent, and format issue.

Each item must:

* Be intended for non-commercial public viewing, and educational/research and use;
* Be in the public domain, or have documented, non-revocable permission granted by the copyright holder, unless access is governed by legislation or a donor agreement;
* Meet the standards required for long-term digital curation, as described by documentation of York University Digital Preservation Program's [Content Types](https://digital.library.yorku.ca/documentation/content-types);
* Be in a standard format accessible through current file viewers, or have a documented conversion path to move the format into a standard format;
* Be intended for permanent storage in York University Digital Library;
* With the exception of self-archiving of published works, items must be unique or novel, a similar or identical digital object should not already exist;
* Be as complete as possible. 

### Level Two

Criteria cover subjective elements requiring review, assessment, and the professional judgement of the [Digital Scholarship Infrastructure Department](https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/about-us/departments/digital-scholarship-infrastructure/) in collaboration with subject experts. As an initial consideration and overarching principle, requests should fit within the mandate of YUL's general collection policy, including that of [YorkSpace](https://yorkspace.library.yorku.ca/xmlui/). Materials should also have broad and enduring value, as opposed to, for example, course-specific materials better housed elsewhere or material for which the demand does not go beyond specific or one-time usage. Research and/or administrative value is defined both locally and globally, with cultural heritage as the priority. Added value components acting as part of the consideration include degree of integration in an online environment, intellectual control (metadata), improvement of resource sharing, and enhancement of access. Finally, a request may receive merit based on its potential as a strategic opportunity, whether in teaching and learning or partnership and collaboration.

## Retention and Evaluation

All objects included in York University Libraries Digital Preservation Program are intended to be retained permanently upon acceptance. Individuals and projects responsible for transferring collections and/or objects to York University Libraries which require significant digital storage space will be responsible for the costs of long-term storage and backup. The York University Librariesâ€™ Digital Preservation Program will not be used as a temporary storage facility.
