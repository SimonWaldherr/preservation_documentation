## Definition of SIP

### Submission Information Package (SIP)

- The information package that is delivered to York University Digital Library for use in the construction of one or more AIPs.
- The format of the SIP may vary from submitter to submitter, based on the submitters willingness and ability to provide the content and metadata in a specific format.
- For a given [Content Type](http://digital.library.yorku.ca/content/content-types), any requirements or restrictions on the type of content that can be contained in the SIP will be described in that Content Type's [Preservation Action Plan](http://digital.library.yorku.ca/tags/preservation-action-plan).
